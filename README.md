# Advent of Code 2023 - Language Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenge. The unique twist for this year is the "One Day, One Language" rule: I am solving each day's challenge in a different programming language. This approach is aimed at both testing and expanding my coding skills across a diverse set of languages.

## Structure
Each folder in this repository represents a day of the challenge, named as `Day01`, `Day02`, ..., `Day25`. Inside each folder, you'll find the solution code, input data, and a brief README explaining the solution and language choice.

## Languages Used
Here is the list of languages used for each day:
- **Day 01:** Java 
- **Day 02:** Python
- ... (and so on)

## Goals
- **Skill Enhancement:** Improve proficiency in various programming languages.
- **Problem-Solving:** Enhance problem-solving skills by adapting to different language paradigms and syntax.
- **Exploration:** Experiment with languages I'm less familiar with and discover new features and techniques.

## Contribution
Feel free to explore the solutions and suggest improvements or alternative approaches. If you're participating in the challenge too, I'd love to see how you approach the problems in different languages!

## Acknowledgments
A big thank you to the Advent of Code team for creating such engaging and challenging problems year after year.
